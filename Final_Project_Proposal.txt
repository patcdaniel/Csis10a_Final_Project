Final Project Ideas - Computing in Java, CSIS10a

1) Voltage Clamp Data Processing
	For the past month we have been running experiments on squid chromatophore muscle fibers. In the past, my PI has done most of the statics by hand
	using Igor. So I would like to make an application to reformat the data text files, visualize individual traces and export the results of some statistics into a
	format that he can play around with.
		-This project can be done in increments and the complexity and capacities could change as desired.

2) Modeling Chromatophore Wave Patterns
	Make an Animation that resembles chromatophore wave patterns, based on stimulation data that we have. The idea is that stimulating squid skin with an small voltage 
	produces an all or nothing propagating wave, causing adjacent chromatophore cells to expand.
		-This project would involve using JavaFX, as based on the feasibility, the behavior of the chromatophore could be changed by size and/or color
		
3) Make a Web App to Collect and Visualize Weather Data from the Hopkins Weather Station and Other Sources. Host our Lab Website
	There are a variety data sources for to get local weather and oceanographic data and it would be interesting to compile them and play around with visualization
