# Final Project Ideas - AxonTextTool- Patrick Daniel #

## Instructions ##
	Run LineChartAxon.java
	This will prompt the user to select a AxonTextFile (.atf), there are several test files in the resources folder.

##Note##
This is a work in progress and it at times I have found it hard to remember why something was done a certain way, especially after learning better ways to do things.
That being said, I am left with a sense of awe and excitement for the prospects of what I can do with java.

thanks,

Patrick
